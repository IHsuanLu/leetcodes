# conclusion
# * 1. Tree has n-1 edges
# * 2. Disjoint Set can detect if there is cycle in graph
# * 3. Graph with less than n-1 edges is definitely not connected
# * 4. Graph with more than n-1 edges definitely has cycle (undirected graph only)

# graph theory
# For the graph to be a valid tree, it must have exactly `n - 1` edges. 
# Any less, and it can't possibly be fully connected.
# Any more, and it has to contain cycles.
# Additionally, if the graph is fully connected and contains exactly n - 1 edges, it can't possibly contain a cycle, and therefore must be a tree!

# Check whether or not there are n - 1 edges. If there's not, then return false.
# Check whether or not the graph is fully connected. Return true if it is, false if otherwise.

# Checking whether or not a graph is fully connected is straightforward â€” we simply checked if all nodes were reachable from a search starting at a single node.
