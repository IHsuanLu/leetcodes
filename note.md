1. consistency is the key
2. make short notes for every problem 
3. revise daily, otherwise there is no point of doing them all
4. first think of bruteforce approach, and then try to optimize it.. if you directly start to optimise the code, you will go nowhere
5. always try to find the patterns in the questions ( most of the questions are just little variations of very few base questions)
6. always dry run the code before testing / submitting
7. practice about complexity (you should be able to tell time and space complexity of the code you have written)
8. interviewbit is far more better than leetcode.. it has standard questions and focuses more on application of concepts..



# A Heap

- is a complete tree
- each node of a min heap is less than all of its children
- allows O(log(N)) to insert and remove an element with priority
- is implemented with arrays
